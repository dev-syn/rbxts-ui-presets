# UIPresets
This is a package that contains various UI presets and components which was designed to ease my development.
You are welcome to use this package I will note that it's mainly designed for personal use.

## Components
Components are designed to include behavior into an existing sort of UI.

### SelectableGroup
SelectableGroup allows you to take a group of "Buttons"(TextButton|ImageButton) and have functionality for selecting these buttons.
This class allows single and multiple buttons to be selected at once.

### ContextMenu
ContextMenu adds a context menu to any "Button"(TextButton|ImageButton) which is activated when the triggerElement is right clicked.
This is still experimental and will likely receive many changes in the future.
